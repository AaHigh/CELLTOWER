## What Is This?

CELLTOWER is a hardcore Tetris trainer built specifically for the iPhone — designed to teach the same high-level techniques used on the original 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System.

This is **v0.420** — the first version that actually runs on a real phone. It’s rough around the edges, it’s opinionated, and it’s only the beginning.

-----

## Why Does This Exist?

NES Tetris is one of the deepest competitive games ever made. The problem: almost nobody knows how to play it correctly. The standard mobile Tetris games teach the wrong habits — they’re casual, forgiving, and fundamentally different from the real thing.

CELLTOWER’s narrow focus right now:

- Play on your iPhone, feel like you’re on a real NES
- Learn to **read the board**, not just react to pieces
- Practice **clean stacking** — keeping holes out of your tower
- Understand **the T-Bonus system** — why clean pieces matter
- See your mistakes in real time via the scoring display

This is piece one of a larger puzzle.

## What’s In v0.420

- ✅ Full NES-accurate piece set with authentic rotation system
- ✅ NES speed curve (Level 1 through kill-screen territory)
- ✅ **Ghost piece system** — 4 look-ahead placements shown as white outlines on the playfield
- ✅ **T-BONUS tracker** — counts your clean piece streak and Tetris bonuses separately
- ✅ **HOLES counter** — live penalty tracking, real-time
- ✅ **Score event ticker** — left panel shows every scoring event as it happens (lines cleared, Tetris!, clean streak fire/ice combos)
- ✅ **AUTO mode** — watch the AI demo optimal play (scores don’t count toward high score)
- ✅ **Transaction Receipt** — tap RECEIPT to see your full scoring history printed as a thermal paper readout from Hightower District, 777 Olive Ave, Fresno CA
- ✅ Touch controls tuned for iPhone 16
- ✅ Runs from a single `index.html` — no build step, no dependencies, no framework

## How To Play

**Tap anywhere** to start. Then:

|Control                  |Action                      |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|
|Tap a ghost outline (1–4)|Place piece at that position|
|↙ ↘ arrows               |Move left / right           |
|↺ ↻ buttons              |Rotate                      |
|↓                        |Soft drop                   |
|⬇ (double tap)           |Hard drop                   |
|PAUSE                    |Pause                       |
|AUTO                     |Toggle AI demo mode         |

**The Ghost Numbers (1–4)** show the 4 best computed placements for the current piece. Number 1 is the AI’s top pick. Tap any ghost to instantly place there.

## Scoring Philosophy

CELLTOWER uses a modified scoring system built around *clean play*:

- **Clean pieces** (no new holes created) build your T-BONUS multiplier
- **Tetris clears** (4 lines at once) pay out big — but only if you’ve been stacking clean
- **Holes** are tracked and penalized. A holey board kills your multiplier
- **AUTO scores** are tracked separately and never overwrite your human high score

The receipt printout at the end of each game shows every transaction — what you earned, when, and why.

-----

## The Bigger Picture

CELLTOWER is one module in a larger project being developed under the **Hightower District** creative umbrella — an intersection of retro gaming, music production, AI tooling, and Fresno culture.

More pieces of the puzzle coming. This is just the playfield.
